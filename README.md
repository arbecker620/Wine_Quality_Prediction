# Wine Quality Prediction


This project was an opportunity to start learning how to set up Github Actions and create a CICD framework for projects. There are a few different goals I am trying to achieve here:

1. Set up GitHub Actiions to do Model Training and upload the model to a Model Regsitry in my Azure ML Studio Subscription. 
2. Create a service in Fast API/Flask to host the model
3. Create a Dockerfile and Container for this model's service to go into Azure
4. Create a database using MongoDB where results can be stored in
